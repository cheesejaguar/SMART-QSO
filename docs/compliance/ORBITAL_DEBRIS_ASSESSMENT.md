| Deployer | TBD (NanoRacks NRCSD, Rocket Lab, etc.) |
| Deployment Orbit | Per launch provider |
| Separation Velocity | Per deployer specification |

## 3. Debris Mitigation Assessment

### 3.1 Assessment 1: Debris Released During Normal Operations

**Requirement:** Limit debris released during normal operations.

**Assessment:** COMPLIANT

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Deployable elements | Antenna: captive after deployment |
| | Solar panels: body-mounted (no deployment) |
| Expendables | None planned |
| Intentional debris | None |
| Paint/coatings | Space-qualified, non-flaking |

**Conclusion:** No debris is intentionally released during normal operations.

### 3.2 Assessment 2: Debris Generated by Explosions

**Requirement:** Minimize potential for post-mission break-ups from stored energy.

**Assessment:** COMPLIANT

**Stored Energy Sources:**

| Source | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Battery | Passivation procedure depletes to safe level (<30% SOC) |
| Propulsion | None (no propulsion system) |
| Pressure vessels | None |
| Reaction wheels | None (magnetorquers only) |
| Momentum wheels | None |

**Passivation Plan:**

1. Upon EOL detection or ground command:
   - Disable battery charging
   - Enable continuous Jetson operation (if functional) to drain battery
   - Transmit final beacon with EOL status
   - Disable RF transmitter
2. Battery will discharge through quiescent loads
3. No residual stored energy capable of causing break-up

### 3.3 Assessment 3: Safe Collision Risk During Operations

**Requirement:** Select safe flight profile and collision avoidance capability.

**Assessment:** COMPLIANT (with acceptance)

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Collision avoidance | No maneuvering capability |
| Tracking | Registered with Space Track |
| Conjunction warnings | Monitored by ground team |
| Response capability | None (accepted for Class D mission) |

**Rationale:** CubeSats without propulsion are common practice. Small size and low mass minimize collision consequences.

### 3.4 Assessment 4: Post-Mission Disposal

**Requirement:** Deorbit within 25 years or move to disposal orbit.

**Assessment:** COMPLIANT

**Deorbit Analysis:**

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Initial altitude | 500 km (worst case) |
| Ballistic coefficient | 33 kg/m² (body only) |
| | 8.3 kg/m² (with drag device) |
| Solar activity | Moderate (F10.7 = 150) |
| Deorbit time (no drag device) | 15 years |
| Deorbit time (with drag device) | 4.5 years |

**Drag Device Specification:**
- Type: Deployable drag sail/tether
- Deployed area: ~0.04 m² effective
- Deployment trigger: EOL command or autonomous timer
- Backup: Autonomous deployment after loss of contact

**Analysis Method:** STK/GMAT orbital propagation with NRLMSISE-00 atmosphere model.

### 3.5 Assessment 5: Reentry Casualty Risk

**Requirement:** Human casualty risk < 1:10,000.

**Assessment:** COMPLIANT

**Demise Analysis:**

| Component | Mass (kg) | Material | Demise Altitude | Survives? |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Structure | 0.40 | Al 7075 | 78 km | No |
| PCBs | 0.15 | FR4/Cu | 72 km | No |
| Battery | 0.20 | Li-ion | 70 km | Partial |
| Jetson | 0.10 | Al/Si | 68 km | No |
| Connectors | 0.05 | Steel | 65 km | Possible |
| Antenna | 0.02 | Steel tape | 60 km | Possible |
| **Total** | **1.33** | | | |

**Surviving Debris Estimate:**
- Total surviving mass: < 50 g
- Number of fragments: < 3
- Largest fragment: < 20 g

**Casualty Expectation Calculation:**

```
Ac = Sum of (Ai) for each surviving fragment
Ac = 0.0001 m² (estimated total casualty area)

Population density (oceanic average): 0.0001 people/m²

Ec = Ac × Population_density = 1 × 10^-8

Ec < 1:10,000 ✓
```

**Conclusion:** Casualty expectation is well below the 1:10,000 threshold.
